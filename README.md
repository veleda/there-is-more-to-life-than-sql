## There is more to life than SQL

Who would have thought?

Let's forget everything we know about tabular data. About rows, columns, cells and JOINS! And let us dive into the wonders of linked data--knowledge graphs!

In this hour we will harvest some openly available datasets, build an ontology, map them accordingly and query it all using SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL).

The session will introduce you to knowledge graphs (RDF), and the building blocks of getting a knowledge graph project up and running. We dive into semantics and ontologies (OWL), and why they are so important in our predictive world of GenAI. We will map our datasets accordingly to the ontology, before loading the data into a graph database. At last, but not least, we will do some SPARQL magic!

All standards and tools used in this session are open-source and free to use.
